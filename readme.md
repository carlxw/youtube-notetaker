# To do
* Experiment opening the scope to this to other websites, as long as it has a video element
    * downside to this is that some websites do not support the timestamp feature

* Implement images so that screenshots can be included with annotations
    * approach 1: Upload to imgur? (single file download)
    * approach 2: local storage and experiment with file zipping? (bulky file)

* Use an options page to control which notes that already exist
    * notes that are not finished
    * download notes from there
    * delete notes from there
    * any other config settings
